# We need an abstract class to monitor the training progress which run on computer node:
## 1. get each placeholder or variable information of summary of tensorflow
## 2. Need investigate the log of keras

# We need an abstract class to generate the summary code for different model of Tensorflow or Keras
## 1. Store the layer-wise weight file 
## 2. Store the layer-wise gradient file
## 3. Store the output of each layer

# We need use logstash and ssh to store or download log into dabase or remote file system
